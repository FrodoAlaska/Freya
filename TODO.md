# TODO 

- BUGS:
    - While RenderDoc shows valid output with the UI renderer, we don't see anything in the application. 

- Systems to work on 
    - renderer
        - complete the camera
    - entity
    - 2D animations
    - 2D cpu-based particles
    - physics 
    - Readme

- Other systems to work on in the future 
    - User-friendly post-process effects
    - Texture atlas component
    - Tilemap component
    - 2D lighting and shadows?
    - Memory arenas and custom allocaters
